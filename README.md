# LolLauncher
LolLauncher is a C++ port of [cfc4n/lol_launcher](https://github.com/cfc4n/lol_launcher), a launcher for _League of Legends_.

At first, I just didn't want to bother with setting up a Go development environment and decided to rewrite cfc4n's launcher into C++ during the rest of the day. Yet I ended up spending a lot more time than expected, since my C++ teacher thinks he's living in the 1980s. __ï¼›P__
